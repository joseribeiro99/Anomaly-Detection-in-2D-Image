# Anomaly-Detection-2D-Images
This project is composed of the following pipeline:

## 1. Get data from the camera [COMPLETE]
Connection to a camera and collection of good data. This data is later supposed to train the model.
There is also the possibility of collecting more than image data in case it shows importance in the future.

## 2. Train anomaly detection model with data collected [IN DEVELOPMENT]
Models are being tested. The one that shows the best results is the one to be deployed.

## 3. Deploy the model [NOT STARTED]
...
